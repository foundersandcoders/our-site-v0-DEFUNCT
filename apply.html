  <h2>The next course</h2>

  <p>We are now taking applications for the course starting in May.</p>

  <h2>The application process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#contact">Join our mailing list</a></li> 
    <li><a href="/apply1.html">Application form, Part 1</a> (the shorter one)</li> 
    <li><a href="/apply2.html">Application form, Part 2</a> (the longer one)</li> 
  </ul>

  <p>Please be aware that we receive many applications for each place and selection is highly competitive.</p>

  <h2>Things you can do to improve your chances of getting on the course</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply early</li>
    <li>Complete the application process to the best of your ability</li>
    <li>Record your voice at an adequate sound level on your video and keep it to under two minutes</li>
    <li>Get yourself on the <a href="http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript">Codewars</a> leaderboard</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Above all, try to communicate through your application that you are capable of handling the workload and that you are committed to using the skills you learn with us after you graduate (and don't bother going out of your way to get friendly with Dan. He wants everyone he meets to do the course, but in the end there are only 16 places in each cohort and selection is not up to him anyway).</p>

  <p>If we like your application, but we do not think you have reached a high enough standard in Codecademy and Codewars, we will let you know and, if you apply early enough, we will hold your application open while you work on the course prerequisites.</p>

  <p>If you want help making progress with the prerequisites and you live in London, you might want to consider signing up for our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/">Monday evening meetups</a>.</p>

  <h2>Which Codecademy courses do you recommend?</h2>

  <p>See the course prerequisites, below. You do not have to finish all of these Codecademy courses before the application deadline, but we do recommend it.</p>

  <h2>Course prerequisites</h2>

  <p>If you have accepted a place on the next course, you will be expected to complete all the material below beforehand. If you have any doubts about your ability to complete any of it, please contact us before the start of the course.</p>

  <h3>Codecademy</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website/"><em>Make a website</em></a></li> 
    <li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-an-interactive-website/"><em>Make an interactive website</em></a></li> 
    <li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web"><em>HTML &amp; CSS</em></a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/jquery"><em>jQuery</em></a></li>

    <li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/youtube"><em>YouTube API</em></a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Codewars</h3>

  <p><a href="http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript">Sign up</a> and see how far you can get with their JavaScript exercises.</p>

  <h3>Courses</h3>

  <p><strong><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/insidetheinternet/"><em>Internet History, Technology, and Security</em></a></strong>. A well-rated and largely non-technical course from the the University of Michigan on Coursera.</p>

  <p><strong>Stanford's <a href="https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/CS101/Summer2014/about"><em>Computer Science 101</em></a></strong>. CS101 is a gentle introduction to programming concepts that uses (a slightly doctored version of) JavaScript, so it is perfect for our purposes. Expect to spend about 10-15 hours on it, including watching the lectures and completing the exercises.</p>

  <h3>Exercises</h3>

  <p><a href="http://flukeout.github.io/#"><strong>CSS Diner</strong></a>. A great way to learn CSS selectors. Hint: the answers to the first three levels are: <em>plate</em>, <em>bento</em> and <em>#fancy</em>. Hopefully, you will be able to take it from there.</p>

  <h3>Reading</h3>

  <p><a href="https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX"><strong>Steve Yegge's Google platforms rant</strong></a>. <em>"Amazon does everything wrong, and Google does everything right...But there's one thing they do really really well that pretty much makes up for ALL of their political, philosophical and technical screw-ups"</em>.</p>

  <h3>Watching</h3>

  <p><a href="http://youtu.be/5Tk09c0FQ3M"><strong>Computer Science: Past, Present, and Future</strong></a>, a talk by Ed Lazowska.</p>

  <p><a href="http://youtu.be/gTAghAJcO1o"><strong>The Future Doesn't Have to Be Incremental</strong></a>, a talk by Alan Kay.</p>

  <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366"><strong>Inventing on Principle</strong></a>, a talk by Bret Victor.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg&list=PL7664379246A246CB"><strong>Crockford on JavaScript</strong></a>. A wonderful series of lectures by Doug Crockford. A panaramic overview of JavaScript at an advanced level. Watch each lecture until you are no longer enjoying the experience and then fast forward or move onto the next one (Lecture 3 is probably the hardest to follow). You may want to rewatch these lectures at the end of the course.</p>

  <h3>Typing</h3>

  <p>Learn to touch type. And make sure that you know not just the main letter keys, but all the outer keys, too. There are many good teaching apps, but <a href="http://www.typingclub.com/">Typing Club</a> is good (and free).</p>
